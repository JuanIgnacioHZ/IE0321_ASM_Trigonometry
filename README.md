# IE0321_ASM_Trigonometry

Homework for Computer architecture I at the School of Electrical Engineering, UCR

The code computes the sine, cosine and tangent of a given angle using taylor series.

The objective was to implement it in MIPS assembly and it was achieved, as a side task the same homework was developed in C language.

Description of all the files:

    - B93826_tarea4_grupo2.s: Homework coded in MIPS assembly.
    - Tarea4.c: Homework coded in C.
    - Tarea4.h: Headers for Tarea4.c.

The assembly software was tested on Mars MIPS emulator and the C code was compiled (with gcc version 14.2.1) as follows:

`gcc -o Tarea4 Tarea4.c`

And then run with `./Tarea4`
